[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is an API driven online payment processing utility. `supabase/wrappers` exposes below endpoints. If you are missing an endpoint feel free to open an issue or even add it yourself.

### Wrapper 
To get started with the Stripe wrapper, create a foreign data wrapper specifying `handler` and `validator` as below.

```sql
create extension if not exists wrappers;

create foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
  handler stripe_fdw_handler
  validator stripe_fdw_validator;
```

### Server 

Next, we need to create a server for the FDW to hold options and credentials.

#### Auth (Supabase)

If you are using the Supabase platform, this is the recommended approach for securing your [Stripe API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).

Create a secure key using pgsodium
```sql
select pgsodium.create_key(name := 'stripe');
```

Save your Stripe API key in Vault and retrieve the `key_id`
```sql
insert into vault.secrets (secret, key_id)
values (
  'sk_test_xxx',
  (select id from pgsodium.valid_key where name = 'stripe')
)
returning
	key_id;
```

Create the foreign server
```sql
create server stripe_server
  foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
  options (
    api_key_id '<your key_id from above>'
  );
```

#### Auth (Insecure)

If the platform you are using does not support `pgsodium` and `Vault` you can create a server by storing your [Stripe API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) directly.


!!! important

    Credentials stored using this method can be viewed as plain text by anyone with access to `pg_catalog.pg_foreign_server`

```sql
create server stripe_server
   foreign data wrapper stripe_wrapper
   options (
     api_key 'sk_test_xxx'
   );
```

### Tables

The Stripe tables mirror Stripe's API.

(Optional) Create a schema to hold the Stripe tables.
```sql
create schema stripe;
```

#### Core resources

##### Balance
*read only*

Shows the balance currently on your Stripe account.

Ref: [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance)

```sql
create foreign table stripe.balance (
  balance_type text,
  amount bigint,
  currency text,
  attrs jsonb
)
  server stripe_server
  options (
    object 'balance'
  );
```

##### Balance Transactions
*read only*

Balance transactions represent funds moving through your Stripe account. They're created for every type of transaction that comes into or flows out of your Stripe account balance.

Ref: [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions/list)

```sql
create foreign table stripe.balance_transactions (
  id text,
  amount bigint,
  currency text,
  description text,
  fee bigint,
  net bigint,
  status text,
  type text,
  created timestamp,
  attrs jsonb
)
  server stripe_server
  options (

  );
```

While any column is allowed in a where clause, it is most efficient to filter by:

- id
- type 

##### Charges
*read only*

To charge a credit or a debit card, you create a Charge object. You can retrieve and refund individual charges as well as list all charges. Charges are identified by a unique, random ID.

```sql
create foreign table stripe.charges (
  id text,
  amount bigint,
  currency text,
  customer text,

  payment_intent text,
  status text,
  created timestamp,

### Examples

Some examples on how to use Stripe foreign tables.

##### Simple Query

```sql
-- always limit records to reduce API calls to Stripe
select * from stripe.customers limit 10;
select * from stripe.invoices limit 10;
select * from stripe.subscriptions limit 10;
```

##### Query JSON Attributes

`attrs` is a common column which stores all the object attributes in JSON format,
you can extract any attributes needed or its associated sub objects from it.
For example,

```sql
-- extract account name for an invoice
select id, attrs->>'account_name' as account_name
from stripe.invoices where id = 'in_xxx';

-- extract invoice line items for an invoice
select id, attrs#>'{lines,data}' as line_items
from stripe.invoices where id = 'in_xxx';

-- extract subscription items for a subscription
select id, attrs#>'{items,data}' as items
from stripe.subscriptions where id = 'sub_xxx';
```

##### Data Modify

```sql
insert into stripe.customers(email,name,description) values ('test@test.com', 'test name', null);
update stripe.customers set description='hello fdw' where id ='cus_xxx';
update stripe.customers set attrs='{"metadata[foo]": "bar"}' where id ='cus_xxx';
delete from stripe.customers where id ='cus_xxx';
```

##### Removing foreign tables

If you would like to remove a foreign table because you do not use it anymore this can be done easily with the following command

```sql
drop foreign table stripe.customers, stripe.invoices, stripe.subscriptions;
```
