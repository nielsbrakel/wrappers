`supabase/wrappers` is OSS. PRs and issues are welcome.

## Development

Requirements:

- rust
- cargo
- docker-compose
- [pgrx](https://github.com/tcdi/pgrx)

### Testing

Tests are located in `./test/sql` with expected output in `./test/expected`

To run tests locally, execute:

```bash
cd wrappers
docker-compose -f .ci/docker-compose.yaml run test-wrappers 
```

### Interactive PSQL Development

To reduce the iteration cycle, you may want to launch a psql prompt with `wrappers` installed to experiment

```bash
cd wrappers
cargo pgrx run pg14 --features clickhouse_fdw
```

Try out the commands below to spin up a database with the extension installed & query a table using GraphQL. Experiment with aliasing field/table names and filtering on different columns.

```sql
> create extension wrappers cascade;
CREATE EXTENSION
```
